// What the window tells a reader who cannot see it.
//
// The scene already knows: every control Compose draws carries semantics, and a tree of
// them is what a screen reader wants. What is missing is a way for that tree to reach the
// platform, and the platform asks for it on its own thread at moments nobody chose. So
// the tree is flattened and pushed whenever it changes, and the shell answers from what
// it was last given.
//
// Flattened rather than kept as a tree. A first tree that says what is there and where is
// worth more than a perfect shape nobody has tested, and the nesting can follow once a
// reader has been heard using this.
