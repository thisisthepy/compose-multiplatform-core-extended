 * opens tells a screen reader what is in it. Its window publishes its three title bar
 * buttons and its title, and every control the application drew is invisible. That is not
 * an oversight in one place that could be worked around from outside, because the tree a
 * reader wants arrives through the scene's platform context, and a window that builds its
 * own leaves no way in.
 *
 * So the scene is built here, with a context that listens. Everything else is what
