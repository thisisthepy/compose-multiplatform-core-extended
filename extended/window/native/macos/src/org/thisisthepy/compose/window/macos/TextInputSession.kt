// Putting text into a field that an input method is composing into is not something
// Compose offers a settled way to do: the commands that do it are marked as still moving.
// They are used here and nowhere else, and pinned to Compose 1.11.1, so a version that
// changes them fails this file rather than quietly typing nothing.
