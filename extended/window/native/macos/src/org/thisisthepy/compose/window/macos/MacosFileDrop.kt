 * target is declared and never filled in, and a target attached through it is never
 * called. So the window takes the drop itself and the screen is told through the same
 * Host event the other platforms send, which is what keeps an application's code the same
 * everywhere.
 *
 * What is carried is paths. A drag of anything else is refused at the edge of the window,
 * so the reader sees the no-entry cursor rather than a drop that quietly does nothing.
