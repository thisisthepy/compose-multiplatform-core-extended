/**
 * The mouse buttons the scene has been told are down, kept honest against the system.
 *
 * A menu the system puts up runs its own event loop until it closes, and the release of the
 * button that opened it, or of the one that chose an item, is taken by that loop and never
 * reaches the window. A scene that heard the press and not the release believes the button
 * is still held, and from then on a click is a second button pressed on top of the first:
 * nothing it is pressed on ever sees a whole click, so every button in the window stops
 * working.
 *
 * The native image's window does not have this problem, because every event it records
 * carries `NSEvent.pressedMouseButtons`, the system's own answer, and the scene takes the
 * buttons from that. The Kotlin/Native window sends a press or a release per event, so it
 * writes down what it sent here and asks [stale] before each event and when a menu closes.
 *
 * Keyed by the system's button numbers: 0 primary, 1 secondary, 2 the middle button.
