/**
 * The layer this window draws into, and the one frame it draws at a time.
 *
 * Skiko has a layer of its own and it is a good one, but it keeps the thing that presents
 * a frame to itself, and that is the piece this window needs. A layer that presents on its
 * own schedule is a refresh out of step with the window's frame, which the window server
 * moves the moment the pointer does. Dragging an edge shows it: the faster the hand, the
 * wider the strip of window that has been claimed and not yet drawn. It was measured at 94
 * pixels at an ordinary speed and 350 at a flick, and in both cases that width divided by
 * the speed of the hand came to one refresh exactly.
 *
 * So the layer is ours. [CAMetalLayer.presentsWithTransaction] says that presenting is part
 * of whatever change to the layer tree is being committed rather than something that
 * happens whenever the frame is ready, and that is what puts the drawing and the window's
 * frame on the screen together.
