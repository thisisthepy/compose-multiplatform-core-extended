/**
 * The layer this window draws into, and the two things about it that a window's edge
 * depends on.
 *
 * These are assertions about what Core Animation actually holds, not about what the code
 * meant to ask for, because both of the settings below are ones a layer has by default in
 * the wrong state and both are invisible from inside the process when they are wrong.
 *
 * What no test here can show is the screen. Whether the drawing and the window's frame
 * arrive together is a fact about what the display server composited, and it is checked by
 * painting the window's background a colour nothing else on the screen is, dragging an edge
 * at a known speed, and counting how many pixels of that colour a capture of the screen
 * holds. Measured that way on 2026-09-25: with a layer that presented on its own schedule
 * the strip averaged 3 pixels at 640 px/s and reached 350 at 28,845 px/s, which in each case
 * is the speed of the hand times one refresh of the screen; with the layer below it was zero
 * at every speed.

    /**
     * A frame starts from nothing, rather than from whatever was in the texture.
     *
     * Metal hands out drawables from a pool, so the texture a frame is given holds a frame
     * from two or three back. Painting straight onto it is invisible while everything
     * drawn is opaque, and it is exactly what the screen shows once anything is not:
     * translucent glass over a page lets an older frame through, and a window that had
     * been resized showed the previous layout standing behind the current one, complete
     * with a second composer and a second sidebar. Nothing in the frame was wrong. What
     * was wrong was underneath it.
     *
     * Cleared to transparent rather than to a colour, because what is behind the window is
     * the platform's business: a window made of chrome has the desktop behind it, and a
     * clear to any colour would paint over that.
