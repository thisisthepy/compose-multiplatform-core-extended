/**
 * Where the scene is drawn and where a click lands in it are the same place.
 *
 * The window that came up in the comparison build drew its content shifted upwards, so its
 * heading was off the top of the window, and no button or field could be clicked. The view
 * the scene draws into had been made from the window's frame, which is a rectangle on the
 * screen, so it sat inside the window offset by the window's own screen position; and the
 * pointer was turned into scene coordinates by subtracting from the view's height, which
 * knows nothing of that offset. The drawing went one way and the pointer the other.
 *
 * The native image path has neither problem because its view is the content view and is
 * flipped, and a click is converted by AppKit into that view. These check that this path
 * follows the same rules: the view covers the content exactly, from its corner, and a point
 * in the window converts to the scene pixel that is drawn under it.
