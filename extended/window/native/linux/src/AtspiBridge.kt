/**
 * This window's presence on the accessibility bus.
 *
 * A desktop with a screen reader runs a second bus for it, apart from the session bus, and an
 * application that wants to be read joins it: the session bus is asked where it is
 * (`org.a11y.Bus.GetAddress`), the application connects there, and tells the registry daemon
 * it exists (`org.a11y.atspi.Socket.Embed`). From then on the registry and its clients call
 * methods on this process's objects, and this process sends signals when something changes.
 *
 * Everything is on the window's own thread. The connection is read without waiting once a turn
 * of the loop, the way the notification centre's is, so a question from Orca is answered in the
 * same turn it was asked in and costs a frame nothing it was not already spending.
 *
 * Failing to join is not an error. A machine with no accessibility bus has no screen reader
 * to serve, and the window carries on without one.
