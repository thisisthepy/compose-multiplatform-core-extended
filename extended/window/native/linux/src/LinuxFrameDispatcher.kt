/**
 * Where a scene's own work runs: on the thread that draws it, once a frame.
 *
 * The Kotlin/Native twin of the desktop renderer's dispatcher, and it exists for the same
 * reason. A scene left to choose for itself hands its work to a dispatcher of the library's
 * choosing, and the Host a renderer talks to belongs to one thread and is invisible from every
 * other: a lazy list asking for the rows it is about to show asked from the wrong thread, found
 * no Host there, and was told nothing had been initialised. The rows never arrived and the list
 * stayed empty.
 *
 * Written again rather than shared because the desktop one holds its work in a
 * `java.util.concurrent` queue, which Kotlin/Native has not got. It needs no concurrent queue
 * either: a scene dispatches from the composition, the composition runs where the frame is
 * drawn, and that is this window's own thread. The Host's worker threads reach this renderer
 * through the frame request counter and never through here.
