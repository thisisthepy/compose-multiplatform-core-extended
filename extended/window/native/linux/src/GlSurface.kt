 * with the transaction it is part of, or the drawing reaches the screen on its own schedule.
 * Here the frame is handed to the display server by [present] and the window manager is what
 * holds it: see [ResizeSync], which owns the ordering.
 *
 * Skia draws straight into the window's back buffer rather than into a texture of its own.
 * There is nothing in between to copy through, and the buffer is described to Skia rather
 * than allocated by it, which is what [BackendRenderTarget] means here.
