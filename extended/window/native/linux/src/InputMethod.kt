// What an input method says, turned into what the shared reader hears.
//
// Apart from the XIM calls in `XimContext.kt` because these are the part that can be wrong
// without anything looking wrong. A preedit edit applied at the wrong offset still shows
// letters; a commit that is dropped when a syllable is finished still shows the syllable
// that was being composed. Both are plain arithmetic on text, and arithmetic is checkable
// without an input method daemon.
//
// Nothing here reaches Rust. What an input method produces is a `WindowEvent` of the kinds
// the window already has, recorded into the same log as a pointer move, and it ends in the
// text input session Compose opened for the focused field. The Host is told a field changed
// by the field, the way it is for a key typed on any other platform.

 * points and not in UTF-16 units, because that is what the protocol counts: a Hangul syllable
 * is one, and so is a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, which is two units.
