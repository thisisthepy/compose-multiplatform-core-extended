 * Every assertion here goes the whole way through: from a keysym or a state mask that X11 handed
 * over, to the Compose key or the modifier bit the interpreter reads. That is the point of them.
 * The number in the middle is the shared numbering, which is AppKit's for historical reasons, and
 * a table that agrees with itself while disagreeing with `composeKey` is the defect these catch:
 * the key still reaches the scene, it still does something, and what it does is what a different
 * key means.
 *
 * Runs on Linux only, because these are the values the system's own headers gave cinterop rather
 * than numbers written down here. That is deliberate: a test that repeated the constants would
 * pass on a machine where the headers say something else.
