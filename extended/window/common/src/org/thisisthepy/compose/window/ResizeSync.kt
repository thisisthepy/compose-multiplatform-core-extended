/**
 * The frame a window manager is holding, and the one rule about letting it go.
 *
 * On X11 the manager moves a window's frame the moment the pointer moves, and what is
 * inside that frame is whatever was last drawn. The two reach the screen in separate steps
 * unless something holds them together, and the strip of window that has been claimed and
 * not yet painted is as wide as the speed of the hand times how late the painting is.
 *
 * What holds them together is a counter. The manager hands out a number with a resize,
 * holds the frame it was about to show, and shows it once the counter carries that number.
 * So the number is a debt: it is owed from the moment the manager asks for it, and the one
 * thing that must never happen is paying it before the drawing exists, because then the
 * manager shows a window whose inside belongs to the previous size. The other thing that
 * must never happen is not paying it at all: a manager waiting on a counter nobody sets
 * holds the window until it gives up on it, which a reader sees as a window that has
 * frozen mid-drag.
 *
 * Both of those are invisible from inside the process and neither is visible in a
 * screenshot, so the ordering lives here rather than in the window: [frameDrawn] hands the
 * drawing over and then pays, [noFrame] pays for a request that produced nothing, and a
 * test can watch the order of the two.
 *
 * This is what X11 has where macOS has a layer that presents with the transaction it is
 * part of.
