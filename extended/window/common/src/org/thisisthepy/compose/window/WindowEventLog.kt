/**
 * Everything a window heard, read from the display server in one place.
 *
 * Why it is one place, and why that is worth a class of its own: a window drawn inside its
 * own resize draws from the middle of reading an event. Anything reached from that drawing
 * which also reads the server takes the rest of the drag out of the queue while the turn
 * that is handling one size change is still running, and the sizes it took are then handled
 * by nobody. The window keeps moving under the hand and stops being painted, which looks
 * like the drawing lagging rather than like a queue being drained twice.
 *
 * So reading is guarded rather than trusted. [read] is the only thing that talks to the
 * server, and a [read] reached from inside a [read] does nothing at all.
 *
 * The events themselves are held rather than delivered, for a different reason: the frame
 * loop wants the scene's own pending work run before it is given new input, so that a list
 * which asked for rows on the last frame has them in hand before this one is measured.
 * [drain] is where the loop takes them.
