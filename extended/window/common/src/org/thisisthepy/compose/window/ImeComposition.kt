// What an input method says, turned into what the shared reader hears.
//
// One model for both X11 windows. The window that links the native image gets the input
// method's callbacks in C and the Kotlin/Native window gets them from Xlib; each hands what
// it was told to this file as plain numbers and text, so a preedit edit applied at the
// wrong offset, or a commit dropped when a syllable is finished, can be wrong in one place
// only and is checked by tests that need no input method daemon.
//
// Nothing here reaches Rust. What an input method produces is a `WindowEvent` of the kinds
// the window already has, recorded into the same log as a pointer move, and it ends in the
// text input session Compose opened for the focused field.

/**
 * The text an input method is still composing, kept the way X's preedit callbacks describe
 * it: as edits to a run of characters.
 *
 * The draw callback does not send the whole string. It says "replace [length] characters
 * from [first] with this", so a client has to hold the run to apply that to. Counted in code
 * points and not in UTF-16 units, because that is what the protocol counts: a Hangul syllable
 * is one, and so is a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, which is two units.

 * - Anything else printable is committed as text and the key event carries no character. A
 *   Hangul syllable put in a key event would be read as one code unit by a field that expects
 *   a character from a keyboard.
 * - An event with no key behind it at all, which is what an input method sends to say it has
 *   committed, produces the commit and no key event: there is nothing for a shortcut to
 *   see, and a key with no name pressed in a text field would only confuse a handler.
