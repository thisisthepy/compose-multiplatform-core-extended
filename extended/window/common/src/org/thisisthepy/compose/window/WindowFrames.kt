/**
 * The one place a frame is drawn from, whoever asked for it.
 *
 * Two things ask. The frame loop asks once a turn, because something in the scene changed
 * or because nothing has been drawn yet. The window asks in the middle of being resized,
 * because the display server has already moved its edge and what is inside that edge is
 * whatever was last painted: a frame produced a turn of the loop later leaves a strip of
 * the window claimed and empty, as wide as the speed of the hand times how late the
 * painting is.
 *
 * Pure, and kept out of the window's own file, because this is the part that can be wrong
 * in a way nobody sees on the platform the author runs. A frame drawn at a size the window
 * no longer has, and a second frame started on top of one already being drawn, are both
 * invisible in a screenshot and both visible to a test.
