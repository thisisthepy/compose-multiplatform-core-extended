// What an X11 server calls a key and a modifier, turned into the numbering the shared reader
// (`composeKey`) understands. The numbering is AppKit's: letters and digits by where they sit
// on a board, special keys by name.
//
// One table for both X11 windows. The window that links the native image hands the keysym
// over untouched, and the Kotlin/Native window reads it from Xlib; both then ask here, so a
// key can no longer mean one thing on one path and another on the other. Plain integers
// rather than Xlib's constants, because this file is compiled for the native image and for
// Kotlin/Native and only the second has the X11 headers. The values are the ones in
// `keysymdef.h` and `X.h`, and the test names the ones that matter.

 * What the X11 window's records become for the scene.
 *
 * The window records what the server and the input method said as it was said: a key as a
 * keysym, a state word and the text it typed, and the preedit callbacks as they came. The two
 * windows on X11 then turn that into events with the same code, `keyEventsFor` and [ImeSession],
 * so the key and the composition mean the same on the native image and on Kotlin/Native.
 *
 * [resetInput] ends the input method's composition and answers what it kept. It is asked when
 * a button goes down while something is being composed, because a click ends the composition
 * and keeps what was typed, which is what the other desktops' input methods do.
