/**
 * The address the window on Windows calls to have a frame drawn.
 *
 * Windows runs a loop of its own inside the handler for the press that starts a drag of
 * the window's edge, and that handler does not return until the reader lets go. The
 * renderer's frame loop is stopped inside it for the whole of the drag, so the window has
 * to reach back into the renderer to get anything drawn at the size it has just become.
 * This is what it reaches: an entry point of the image, taken as a plain C function
 * pointer and handed to the window's own code.
 *
 * Java rather than Kotlin, and this is the second Java file in the renderer for the same
 * shape of reason as the first. The literal below needs the class holding the entry point
 * as a class literal, the entry point has to be a genuinely static method, and a Kotlin
 * file's methods are static on a facade class that Kotlin has no way to name.
 *
 * Nothing about the Host crosses here. This is the renderer's platform code calling the
 * renderer, on the one thread both of them live on.
