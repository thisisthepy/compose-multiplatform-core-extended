// A window that is ours on Windows, drawn into with Skia and with no toolkit in between.
//
// The pair of `AppKitWindow.kt`, and beside it for the same reason it is beside
// `NativeHostConnection`: these are the only places that name GraalVM types, so a
// development run on a JVM never loads them.
//
// The C side is `c/win32_window.c`. It owns the window, the Direct3D device, the queue,
// the adapter and the swapchain, and answers with the pointers. Nothing there draws.
//
// The same C symbols the macOS file calls, because the two C files are alternatives:
// exactly one of them is compiled into an image, and each answers for the window its own
// platform knows how to open. What the five pointers mean differs, which is why each
// platform reads them here rather than sharing a struct. What an event looks like does
// not differ, so `WindowEvent` and `drainWindowEvents` are the macOS file's and used as
// they are, and so are the shell's own turns: `pumpWindowEvents` and `isWindowClosed`
// name what every window does and are declared once, there.
