/**
 * The corner outline, measured as a real path.
 *
 * These belong to the JVM rather than to the common test set because they build the
 * outline and then measure what came out, and that needs a graphics backend that actually
 * draws. The desktop JVM has one. Android's local unit test JVM does not: every method on
 * android.graphics.Path throws unless the test runs on a device or against an emulated
 * framework, so running these there would be testing Google's stub rather than this
 * module's geometry.
 *
 * The arithmetic that decides those paths, the superellipse exponent and the concentric
 * inset, stays in the common set and runs on every target. What is checked here is only
 * the step from that arithmetic to an outline, and one real backend settles it.
