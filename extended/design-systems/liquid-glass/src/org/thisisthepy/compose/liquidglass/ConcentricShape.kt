/**
 * A rounded rectangle whose corners are continuous rather than circular.
 *
 * A circular corner joins the straight edge at a point where curvature jumps from zero to
 * 1/r. The eye reads that jump as a seam, which is why a circularly rounded rectangle
 * looks slightly pinched at the corners next to Apple's. A continuous corner spreads the
 * curvature over a longer stretch of the edge so it rises from zero smoothly, and the
 * corner reads as one shape rather than an arc glued between two lines.
 *
 * The curve here is a superellipse quarter, |x|^n + |y|^n = 1 with n = [EXPONENT]. That is
 * not the exact spline Apple uses, which is unpublished, but it has the property that
 * matters: curvature at the join is continuous, and the corner is visibly fuller than a
 * circular one of the same radius.
 *
 * The outline is a sampled polyline rather than an analytic curve, because a superellipse
 * of arbitrary exponent has no exact bezier form. [SEGMENTS] samples per corner is far
 * below the point where a sample step is visible at any plausible corner radius.
