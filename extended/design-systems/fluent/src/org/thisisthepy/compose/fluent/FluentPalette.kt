/**
 * The Fluent 2 colour ramps this design system resolves roles from.
 *
 * Microsoft publishes Fluent 2 as a specification and a set of design tokens, not as a
 * Compose library, so these values are transcribed from that token set rather than read
 * out of a dependency. Each field says which token it is, so a reader can check one
 * against the published ramp without reading the role mapping first.
 *
 * Two instances, [Light] and [Dark], because Fluent does not merely invert: the accent
 * moves several steps up its brand ramp for dark, and the foreground that sits on the
 * accent flips from white to near black.
