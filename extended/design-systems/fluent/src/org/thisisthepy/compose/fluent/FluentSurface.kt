/**
 * Draws a raised Fluent surface: its fill, its shadow, and the lit line along its top.
 *
 * Nothing else in this project draws the top stroke, and it is the detail that separates
 * a Fluent card from a rectangle with a shadow under it, so the drawing lives here rather
 * than being left as a value in [ElevationStyle] for every caller to remember.
 *
 * The shadow is drawn twice on purpose. Fluent specifies each of its depths as two
 * layers: a tight, darker one that sits right under the edge and reads as contact, and a
 * wide, fainter one that reads as distance from the page. One shadow at the full depth
 * gives a soft blob with no edge; one at the tight depth gives a hard edge with no
 * depth. Material needs neither because it tints the surface instead.
