/**
 * The vocabulary a caller speaks to a design system.
 *
 * A caller names a role. The design system decides what it looks like. That direction is
 * the whole point: it is what lets a fourth design system be added without touching a
 * single widget, and what stops Cupertino and Fluent from becoming skins over Material.
 *
 * These deliberately mirror the renderer's protocol enums without importing them. Two
 * declarations of the same vocabulary is the price of this project being publishable on
 * its own, and the renderer owns the mapping between them.
