/**
 * The contract every design system in this project implements.
 *
 * A caller names a role. The design system answers with pixels. That direction is the
 * whole point of the split: a widget never says "blue" or "8dp corner", it says
 * `ColorRole.Primary` and `ShapeRole.Medium`, so the same widget code draws a Material
 * button, a Cupertino one and a Fluent one without knowing that any of them exist.
 *
 * Adding a seventh design system therefore means writing one more implementation of this
 * interface. It does not mean touching a widget.
 *
 * Everything here is resolved for one colour scheme. Light and dark are two instances,
 * not a flag threaded through every call, because a design system is free to change more
 * than colours between them.
