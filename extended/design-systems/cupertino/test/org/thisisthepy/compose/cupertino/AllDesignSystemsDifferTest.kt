/**
 * All six systems, asked the same questions side by side.
 *
 * The other cross system tests cover a pair and a trio: Material against Fluent, and the
 * three Linux systems against each other. Neither of them ever asks Cupertino anything,
 * so until this existed a design system could have collapsed onto another one's values in
 * five of the fifteen pairings and every test in the project would still have passed.
 *
 * What is asserted here is that no two systems answer a whole family of roles the same
 * way. It is deliberately not "no two systems ever agree on any single role", because
 * they legitimately do and should: a square corner is a square corner, white is the only
 * sensible label on half of these accent colours, and Material and Deepin both happen to
 * round a medium container at twelve. Those coincidences are not the failure mode. The
 * failure mode is a system that is another system with the numbers nudged, and a system
 * that answers an entire ladder identically to its neighbour is exactly that.
