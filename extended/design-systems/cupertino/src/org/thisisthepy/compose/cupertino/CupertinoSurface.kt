/**
 * A Cupertino card: glass over the content behind it, on a continuous corner, with the
 * wide soft shadow this system raises things with.
 *
 * [backdrop] is what shows through. Passing nothing is not a mistake, it is the common
 * case of a surface on a plain canvas, and the surface is still translucent and still
 * edge lit; it simply has a flat colour behind it rather than content.
 *
 * Nesting one of these inside another is how depth is made here. The inner one sees the
 * outer one's tint already applied, so it reads as a layer over a layer without either of
 * them drawing a heavier shadow, and [inner] cuts its corner to stay concentric.
