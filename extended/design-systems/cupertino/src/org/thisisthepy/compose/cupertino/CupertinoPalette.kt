/**
 * Apple's system colours, transcribed rather than depended on.
 *
 * Apple ships no Compose library, so these come from the published system colour and
 * system grey tables. alexzhirkevich/compose-cupertino is a readable cross check for the
 * same values and is deliberately not a dependency: it targets Kotlin 1.9 where this
 * project is on 2.4, and it predates the material change in macOS 26 and iOS 26, so
 * adopting it would mean pinning the toolchain back to get a palette that is out of date
 * anyway.
 *
 * Two instances, because Apple's colours are not an inversion of each other. The system
 * blue moves from 0x007AFF to a lighter 0x0A84FF so that it survives against a black
 * background, the greys renumber from the top of the ramp rather than flipping, and the
 * grouped background goes to pure black while the cards on it go lighter, which is the
 * opposite of what light mode does.
 *
 * The label colours are the opaque forms. Apple publishes secondary and tertiary labels
 * as a black or white with an alpha, and those alphas are correct over a known
 * background; a role in this contract has to answer with a colour that means something
 * on its own.
