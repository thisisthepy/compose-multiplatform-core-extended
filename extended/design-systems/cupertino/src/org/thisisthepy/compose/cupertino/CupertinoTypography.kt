/**
 * The type scale, mapped from Apple's named text styles onto the nine roles.
 *
 * Apple's scale is San Francisco at its default Dynamic Type size: Large Title 34, Title 1
 * 28, Title 2 22, Title 3 20, Body 17, Subheadline 15, Caption 12. The sizes and leadings
 * here are those, which is why they are not a geometric ladder: Apple's steps narrow
 * towards the body size because that is where reading happens.
 *
 * Two details of San Francisco are worth carrying even without the font itself. Tracking
 * is negative at body size and positive at display sizes, because SF tightens as it grows
 * and the optical sizes are what make Apple text look set rather than typed. And Body and
 * BodyStrong are the same size and leading, differing only in weight, so that emphasis
 * inside a paragraph does not reflow it.
 *
 * The font family is deliberately the platform default rather than a named one. San
 * Francisco is not licensed for redistribution, and asking for it by name gets it on
 * Apple platforms and nothing anywhere else. The default resolves to San Francisco on
 * macOS and iOS, which is where this design system is the platform look, and to the
 * host's own UI face elsewhere, which is a better outcome than a silent substitution.
